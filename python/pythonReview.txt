Python
Personal review [BS shabalala]
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics,
designed to be easy as well as fun, Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language.

Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting,
and is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing 
components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding.
Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasison readability.
Additionally,Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code.
Python is an open-source community language, so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries 
and functionality for it. Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
and scientific computing. Developers also use Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps.
