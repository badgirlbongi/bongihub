Python
Personal review [BS shabalala]
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics,
designed to be easy as well as fun, Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language.

Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting,
and is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing 
components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding.
Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasison readability.
Additionally,Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code.
Python is an open-source community language, so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries 
and functionality for it. Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
and scientific computing. Developers also use Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps.

Features and Benefits of Python :
•	Compatible with a variety of platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and others.
•	Uses a simple syntax comparable to the English language that lets developers use fewer lines than other programming languages.
•	Operates on an interpreter system that allows code to be executed immediately, fast-tracking prototyping.
•	Can be handled in a procedural, object-orientated, or functional way.

What I have learned :
•   python has a variety of libraries and extensions that allows you to create any kind of application you want 
    and how you want it to be like or run like for example creating a web application using Django.
•   The fact that it uses or accesses cmd is the best feature because you get to work with different directories 
    and it having the advantageof using that gives you the freedom to create application in different folders using different 
    libraries/extensions without disturbing/affecting other applications created in different folders.
•   The language itself is straightforward and easy to work around with
•   The math and other things are practically the same as all the other programming languages even though the syntax may differ
    because this one is much simpler
•   On the if statements python has an interesting feature called "elif" which is more like an elseif statement
