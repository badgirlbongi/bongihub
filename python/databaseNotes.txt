-you can use sqlite for database uses in python especially if yoou're dealing with small manageable data
- did the first steps of connecting to a database
import sqlite3

#connect to a (new) database
conn = sqlite3.connect("C:\\demo\\alpha.db")

#close connection
conn.close()
-and program did not run error being an operational error
-i have to download a new database host since i cant use phpmyadmin and i don't have alpha db 
- turns out alpa.db is just a name of the database not a host or anything
#connect to a (new) database
conn = sqlite3.connect("namesample.db")
-and all is well now now next to the next step
-create a cursor
cur = conn.cursor()
- create a table and use the (if not exists) to avoid errors and duplicate tables
-use the execute property to create the table via the cursor and 
use the commit via connection to post the sql statements
#create a cursor
cur = conn.cursor()

#create a "people" table
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people
               (firstname TEXT, lastname TEXT)''')
conn.commit()

#close connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
- you can also create the table without using the cursor 



- don't forget to close all the hings you've opened like the cursor and the connection
