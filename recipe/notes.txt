Title: Recipe Recommendation System

Description:
Create a recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes to users based on their preferences, 
dietary restrictions, and ingredients they have on hand. The system will allow users to input their 
dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), any allergies or restrictions, and the
ingredients they currently have in their kitchen.

The project can involve the following components:

User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input their preferences, allergies, 
and available ingredients.

Database Management: Set up a database to store a collection of recipes along with their ingredients, 
instructions, and tags (e.g., cuisine type, meal type).

Recommendation Algorithm: Implement an algorithm that analyzes user preferences and available ingredients
to recommend relevant recipes. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based 
filtering, or a hybrid approach.

Integration with External APIs: Integrate with external APIs (such as ingredient databases or recipe APIs)
to fetch additional recipe data or ingredient information.

Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort recipe recommendations based on various criteria 
like preparation time, difficulty level, or ratings.

User Feedback: Incorporate a feature where users can provide feedback on recommended recipes, helping to
improve future recommendations.

Email Notifications: Optionally, set up a system to send email notifications with personalized recipe
suggestions to registered users.

Deployment: Deploy the application so that it can be accessed online, either as a web application or a 
mobile app.

This project will involve working with databases, APIs, user interfaces, and algorithms, providing a 
comprehensive learning experience in Python programming. Additionally, it has real-world applications 
for anyone looking for meal inspiration or trying to make the most of the ingredients they have at home.
